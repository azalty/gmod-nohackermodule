# gmod-nohackermodule
An addon that permanently bans players that are in admin usergroups and not whitelisted: rlevet_nohackermodule for gmod\
Also logs everything in /data/nohacker_module/reports/

### Warning!
- You need ulx&ulib.
-If you are using multiple admin systems at the same time (like FAdmin and Ulx at the same time), the user might not be demoted. This is due to the fact that the user is deleted from Ulx admin list but not from FAdmin admin list. You will have to remove this user from FAdmin or give him a usergroup with Ulx if you want to unban him. Else, it won't be a problem.

(And yes, I know, if players find a way to become admin after the spawn, it won't do a shit. I'm planning to do something against that) [Try using v5 Public Test, a new hook has been added in it]
