# gmod-nohackermodule
An addon that permanently bans players that are in admin usergroups and not whitelisted: rlevet_nohackermodule for gmod\
Also logs everything in /data/nohacker_module/reports/

### Warning!
This addon is called EVERY TIME a player spawns. This may cause lag on very big servers.\
(And yes, I know, if players find a way to become admin after the spawn, it won't do a shit. I'm planning to do something against that)
